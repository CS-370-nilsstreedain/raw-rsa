# RSA Encryption / Decryption
Here we will play a RSA encryption/decryption game with an agent (doesn't it sound very very exciting?). You proceed to the `raw-rsa` folder and find the `template.py` file ready.

If we run `launcher`, it will run the `template.py` and we will play the exciting game with the agent.
1. Your `template.py` has `N` and `e`
2. You are required to encrypt `quiz_number` (M in our slides)
3. The script will send `encrypted quiz_number` to the agent
4. The agent will send `d` (private key) and ask to decrypt `C`
5. You are required to decrypt `C` and send it

This will be played for 10 times. If you win'em all, you will have the flag.
